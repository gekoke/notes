--- Types of networks ---

    WANs - wide area networks, connect LANs -- can use copper, fibre or wireless -- usually slower, larger geographically
        Public - i.e. the Internet
        Private - for private use ("an internet")


    Types of large-scale networks:
        The Internet - Extranet - Intranet
        The world    - Clients  - Institution only

    Types of home internet connections:
        DSL - telephone line
        Cable - television cable
        Cellular
        Satellite
        Dial-up telephone - telephone line, can't use internet during call

    Types of business internet connections:
        Dedicated leased lines - "reserved" lines by ISP
        VPN - privatized connection through the Internet
        Metro ethernet - long-distance LAN-like technology
        Business DSL - undiluted form of DSL
        Satellite


    Internet is maintained by: IETF, ICANN, IAB


--- Converging networks --- 


Problem: telephone, video, data (fax?) etc. use different protocols...
    Converging network - combines all services

    Creates a single point of failure --- ensure reliability!
        
        Reliable networks:
            Fault tolerance:
                Have 2 ISPs, have 2 routers etc.
                    - fun example: president never travels with second-in-line to power, in case they both die/get injured in the same place
                    - "fun" example 2: WTC had back-up facilities/databases/staff and therefore functioned normally after 9/11
            
            Scalability:
                Ensure no performance degradation when userbase etc. increases

            Quality of Service:
                Different services are prioritized differently:
                    - emails, file transfers take a bit longer -- Acceptable
                    - streaming, calls are not prioritized     -- Unacceptable 
            
            Security:
                Network infrastructure security:
                    - ensure the thing doesn't burn to the ground
                    - ensure that unauthorized persons can't physically access the network

                Information security:
                    - ensure that the information is not available to unauthorized persons


--- Recent network trends ---


- Cloud computing
- Video communications / collaboration
- Smart home
    Cook scheduled meals, notify if out of eggs etc.
- Powerline networking
    Attach a powerline adapter:
        converts home electricity into an information transfer medium


--- Network security ---


External threats
    - DDoS
    - Words, trojans etc.

Internal threats
    - Malicious employees
    - Accidental misuse
    - Lost devices
