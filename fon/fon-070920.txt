Methods of accessing a routing device:
    - Console (physical port)
    - SSH (Secure Shell), over network (encrypted)
    - Telnet, over network (plaintext)

Modes in Cisco IOS:
    - User EXEC (read only):
    - Privileged EXEC:
        - Global config mode (config):
            - Line config mode (Console, SSH configuration)
            - Interface config mode (used to configure interface I guess)

Boot sequence:
    - POST:
        - ROM (reads instructions)
        - Flash (moves OS to RAM)
        - Moves startup-config from NVRAM (non-volatile) to RAM
    - startup-config is saved to NVRAM, which is a type of RAM that is persitent across power-losses


IP address structure:
    - 192.168.1  --- Network
        - Continent -> Country -> City
    - .1         --- Host
    - .0         --- means "x", or any host, used to signify network addresses

    - Subnet masks:
        - Signifies if certain part of IP address represents network, or host
        - 255 means network, 0 means host

    - Gateway:
        - Host in the network that acts as gate to Internet

    - DNS:
        - Converts web address to IP address

    - Switches:
        - Only have VLAN(?)
