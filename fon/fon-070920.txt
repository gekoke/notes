Methods of accessing a routing device:
    - Console (physical port)
    - SSH (Secure Shell), over network (encrypted)
    - Telnet, over network (plaintext)

Modes in Cisco IOS:
    - User EXEC (read only):
    - Privileged EXEC:
        - Global config mode (config):
            - Line config mode (Console, SSH configuration)
            - Interface config mode (used to configure interface I guess)


Boot sequence:
    - POST:
        - reads OS from ROM (read-only memory)
        - flashes OS to RAM
    - Config files:
        - in RAM:
            - running-config
        - in NVRAM:
            - startup-config
            - persistent across power-losses
