Methods of accessing a routing device:
    - Console (physical port)
    - SSH (Secure Shell), over network (encrypted)
    - Telnet, over network (plaintext)

Modes in Cisco IOS:
    - User EXEC (read only):
    - Privileged EXEC:
        - Global config mode (config):
            - Line config mode (Console, SSH configuration)
            - Interface config mode (used to configure interface I guess)


Boot sequence:
    - POST:
        - ROM (reads instructions)
        - Flash (moves OS to RAM)
        - Moves startup-config from NVRAM to RAM
    - startup-config is saved to NVRAM, which is a type of RAM that is persitent across power-losses
